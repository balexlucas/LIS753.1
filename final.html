                <p>The first World Cup took place in 1930 in Uruguay, featuring thirteen teams. Taking place every four years hence, the format has changed and expanded as its popularity grew, eventually becoming standardized as a 16-team tournament in 1954, a 24-team tournament in 1982, and a 32-team tournament in 1998. The World Cup in 2026 is the first in history to feature 48 teams, meaning many nations will be making their first ever appearance at the tournament, along with some nations that haven’t qualified in decades.</p>
                <p>The qualification process for the FIFA World Cup is arduous and long, meaning the tournament represents the culmination of many years’ hard work and preparation for the 48 national teams that successfully qualified. For many, simply making it to the World Cup represents a great accomplishment, while for others, success will be defined only by deep runs into the tournament or outright victory.</p>
                <p>The tournament starts with a group stage where teams are drawn into groups of four where each play three games, one against every other team in the group. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw. After three games, the two teams with the most points from each group, along with the eight third place teams with the most points, progress to a single-elimination tournament used to determine the World Cup Champion.</p>
