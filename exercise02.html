        This is the first page I've ever coded! I'd like to use this space to pay tribute to Frankie Klopas, Chicago Fire legend and hometown hero responsible for scoring the goal in the US Open Cup to deliver an unprecedented and unmatched domestic double in the team's first season. Proud of you, Frank!

        The cat above is not Frank Klopas. I did briefly attempt to find a way to include an image of him instead, but didn't find a way through. Looking forward to learning how to do that later!
