        <p>The sale takes place once a month. On Saturday and Sunday, the Main Room opens at 11am. The Children's Books and Bargain Book rooms open at 10am.</p>
        <p>Some customers come early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line and the best shot at the newly available books. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room sale starting at 8am on Saturday. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves you a spot in line corresponding to that number. Once you have your ticket, you can go get a coffee, go for a walk, or visit the Children’s and Bargain Book rooms in advance of the Main Room opening. However, be sure to be back in line at the Main Room a few minutes before it opens, as missing your entry time will forfeit your place in line. If you arrive after the tickets are distributed, simply join the end of the line. There are no tickets distributed on Sunday.</p>

          <h3 id="Capacity and limits">Capacity and Limits</h3>
            <p>Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time.</p>
            <p>On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted to the Main Room in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11am. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off the shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and re-enter the line. The limitation of 12 book at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.</p>

          <h3>Are book donations accepted?</h3>

          <h3>Why is the library selling books?</h3>
            <p>The library sale is made up mostly of donations from individuals, estates, and companies, along with items removed from the Palo Alto library shelves to make room for new purchases. It is a great way for the community help support the library financially and clear out some much needed space for exciting new materials!</p>
          <h3>When should I arrive for the sale?</h3>
            <p>That depends! If you only intend to shop in the Children’s and Bargain Rooms, you can arrive and shop any time after 10am.</p>

We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room sale starting at 8am on the Saturday of the sale. If arriving after tickets are handed out, simply join the line.</p>
