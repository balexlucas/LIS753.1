        <p>The sale takes place once a month. On Saturday and Sunday, the Main Room opens at 11am. The Children's Books and Bargain Book rooms open at 10am.</p>
        <p>Some customers come early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line and the best shot at the newly available books. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room sale starting at 8am on Saturday. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves you a spot in line corresponding to that number. Once you have your ticket, you can go get a coffee, go for a walk, or visit the Children’s and Bargain Book rooms in advance of the Main Room opening. However, be sure to be back in line at the Main Room a few minutes before it opens, as missing your entry time will forfeit your place in line. If you arrive after the tickets are distributed, simply join the end of the line. There are no tickets distributed on Sunday.</p>
